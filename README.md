# Habit Tracker App

## Motivation

I created this Habit Tracker app as a personal project to help me develop better habits and improve my daily routines. The main motivations behind building this app were:

1. **Personal Growth**: I wanted a tool that could help me track and visualize my progress in forming new habits and breaking bad ones.

2. **Learning Experience**: As an aspiring developer, I saw this project as an opportunity to apply and expand my skills in modern web development technologies.

3. **Customization**: While there are many habit tracking apps available, I wanted to create something tailored to my specific needs and preferences.

4. **Data-Driven Improvement**: By collecting data on my habits, I aimed to gain insights into my behavior patterns and make informed decisions about my personal development.

## What I Learned

Developing this Habit Tracker app has been an incredible learning experience. Here are some key takeaways from the project:

1. **React and Next.js**: I deepened my understanding of React hooks and state management. Working with Next.js taught me about server-side rendering and the benefits of the App Router.

2. **TypeScript**: Implementing the app in TypeScript improved my skills in static typing and helped me catch errors early in the development process.

3. **State Management**: Using Zustand for state management taught me about creating a centralized store and managing complex application state.

4. **UI/UX Design**: Designing the user interface helped me understand the importance of user experience in app development. I learned to create intuitive layouts and responsive designs.

5. **Data Visualization**: Implementing charts and statistics for habit tracking improved my skills in data visualization and working with libraries like Recharts.

6. **Local Storage and Data Persistence**: I learned how to use browser local storage to persist data, providing a seamless experience for users across sessions.

7. **Dark Mode Implementation**: Adding a dark mode feature taught me about theme switching and designing for different color schemes.

8. **Form Handling**: Creating forms for adding and editing habits improved my understanding of form state management and validation in React.

9. **Date Manipulation**: Working with dates for habit tracking and statistics calculation enhanced my skills in JavaScript date manipulation.

10. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the app works well on various screen sizes taught me about responsive web design principles and techniques.

11. **Git Version Control**: Throughout the development process, I improved my Git skills, learning about branching, merging, and maintaining a clean commit history.

12. **Project Structure**: Organizing the project files and components taught me about maintaining a scalable and maintainable codebase.

13. **Accessibility**: Implementing accessible features made me more aware of the importance of creating inclusive web applications.

14. **Performance Optimization**: I learned techniques to optimize the app's performance, such as memoization and efficient rendering.

## Future Improvements

While developing this app, I've identified several areas for future improvement:

- Implementing user authentication for multi-user support
- Adding data synchronization across devices
- Enhancing data visualization with more detailed analytics
- Implementing push notifications for habit reminders
- Adding social features for habit sharing and community support

This project has been a significant step in my journey as a developer, and I'm excited to continue improving and expanding its features.

1. For prducttion use we can't not directly request to insecture api endpoint, so we need to implement inside api/folder in nextjs
2. Even when user toggle complete habit it take almost 700ms greatly slow, so we need to implement optimistic update parttern
